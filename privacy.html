        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>
        <p>
          Your privacy is our top priority. Because our tools work entirely
          within your web browser, we do not collect your personal documents.
        </p>

        <h3>1. File Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>FixMyFile does not upload your files to any server.</strong>
          All conversions (Word to PDF, Image Resizing, etc.) happen locally on
          your device using JavaScript. Your data stays with you.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
          We do not store any personally identifiable information. Standard web
          logs (IP addresses and browser types) may be used for security and
          traffic analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Cookies & Advertisements</h3>
        <p>
          We may use third-party advertising companies (like Google) to serve
          ads when you visit our website. These companies may use cookies to
          provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
